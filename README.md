# ame-gupy-starwars

A simple API that manages planet registrations, and that automatically retrieves
the amounts of films the planet is present in from [SWAPI](https://swapi.co) to feed the database.

**Author's Note**: This is my first time using Vert.x, JOOQ and Hybernate in practice only knowing their concepts,
and coding this API been a great learning process altogether.

## Requirements
